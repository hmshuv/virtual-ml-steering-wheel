# Virtual Steering Wheel Controller for Car Racing Game

This project is a virtual steering wheel controller that allows you to control a car in a racing game using hand gestures detected through a webcam. The project utilizes computer vision techniques to recognize gestures and translate them into keyboard inputs that control the game.

## Features
- **Steering**: Move your hand to the left or right to steer the car.
- **Nitro Boost**: Gesture downwards to activate a nitro boost.
- **Real-time Gesture Recognition**: The system processes video input in real-time, making the gaming experience responsive and interactive.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the virtual steering wheel controller on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from the official website: [Python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
```

### Install Dependencies

You can install the required dependencies using pip. Run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Application

Execute the `tutorial.py` script to start the virtual steering wheel controller:
```bash
python tutorial.py
```

## How it Works

1. The webcam captures video input.
2. The video frames are processed to detect specific hand gestures.
3. The recognized gestures are translated into keyboard inputs to control the car in the game.

### Controls

- **Steering Left**: Move your hand to the left.
- **Steering Right**: Move your hand to the right.
- **Nitro Boost**: Move your hand downwards.
