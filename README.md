# Gesture-Based Control System

This project allows users to control keyboard actions using color-based gestures captured through a webcam. The system detects specific colors in the video feed and triggers corresponding key presses.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- `pip` for managing Python packages.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gesture-control.git
   cd gesture-control
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

   Install the necessary Python packages using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python imutils numpy pynput
   ```

   - `opencv-python`: For capturing and processing video feed.
   - `imutils`: For easier OpenCV usage.
   - `numpy`: For numerical operations.
   - `pynput`: For controlling the keyboard programmatically.

## Usage

1. **Run the code:**

   Ensure your webcam is connected and accessible. Run the `tutorial.py` file to start the gesture recognition system:

   ```bash
   python tutorial.py
   ```

2. **Control the system:**

   The system will display a window showing the webcam feed. It recognizes color-based gestures:
   - **LEFT**: Move the object to the left side of the screen to trigger the 'A' key.
   - **RIGHT**: Move the object to the right side of the screen to trigger the 'D' key.
   - **NITRO**: Move the object to the bottom center to trigger the 'Space' key.

3. **Exit the program:**

   Press the `q` key to quit the program.

## Customization

To modify the color range detected by the system, you can adjust the `colourLower` and `colourUpper` variables in the script. These define the HSV color ranges for the object being tracked.

Example:

```python
colourLower = np.array([94, 138, 115])
colourUpper = np.array([180, 255, 255])
```

Change the values to suit your desired color range.

## Files

- `tutorial.py`: Main script that runs the gesture detection and keyboard control.
- `color.py`: Utility file for color detection (ensure this is correctly referenced in the main script).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Make your changes and commit them (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
5. Open a pull request.
